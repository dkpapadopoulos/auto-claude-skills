# Temp-File Execution Pattern — Worked Example

Read with Constraint 3 (Tier 2 only), before the first LQL query run through `gcloud`; the rule itself stays in `SKILL.md`. Moved verbatim from `SKILL.md`.

```bash
LQL_FILE=$(mktemp /tmp/agent-lql-XXXXXX.txt)
cat > "$LQL_FILE" << 'QUERY'
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
AND resource.labels.service_name="checkout-service"
AND severity>=ERROR
AND timestamp>="2026-03-19T10:00:00Z"
QUERY

gcloud logging read "$(cat "$LQL_FILE")" \
  --project=my-project --format=json --limit=50 ; rm -f "$LQL_FILE"
```

The `;` operator ensures cleanup runs regardless of whether `gcloud` succeeds or fails. `mktemp` with a random suffix prevents concurrent sessions from overwriting each other's queries.
